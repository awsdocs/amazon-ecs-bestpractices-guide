# Configuring service auto scaling<a name="capacity-autoscaling"></a>

An Amazon ECS service is a managed collection of tasks\. Each service has an associated task definition, a desired task count, and an optional placement strategy\. Amazon ECS service auto scaling is implemented through the Application Auto Scaling service\. Application Auto Scaling uses CloudWatch metrics as the source for scaling metrics\. It also uses CloudWatch alarms to set thresholds on when to scale your service in or out\. You provide the thresholds for scaling, either by setting a metric target, referred to as *target tracking scaling*, or by specifying thresholds, referred to as *step scaling*\. After Application Auto Scaling is configured, it continually calculates the appropriate desired task count for the service\. It also notifies Amazon ECS when the desired task count should change, either by scaling it out or scaling it in\.

To use service auto scaling effectively, you must choose an appropriate scaling metric\. We discuss how to choose a metric in the following sections\.

## Characterizing your application<a name="capacity-autoscaling-app"></a>

Properly scaling an application requires knowing the conditions where the application should be scaled in and when it should be scaled out\. In essence, an application should be scaled out if demand is forecasted to outstrip capacity\. Conversely, an application can be scaled in to conserve costs when resources exceed demand\.

### Identifying a utilization metric<a name="capacity-autoscaling-app-utilizationmetric"></a>

To scale effectively, it's critical to identify a metric that indicates utilization or saturation\. This metric must exhibit the following properties to be useful for scaling\.
+ The metric must be correlated with demand\. When resources are held steady, but demand changes, the metric value must also change\. The metric should increase or decrease when demand increases or decreases\.
+ The metric value must scale in proportion to capacity\. When demand holds constant, adding more resources must result in a proportional change in the metric value\. So, doubling the number of tasks should cause the metric to decrease by 50%\.

The best way to identify a utilization metric is through load testing in a pre\-production environment such as a staging environment\. Commercial and open\-source load testing solutions are widely available\. These solutions typically can either generate synthetic load or simulate real user traffic\.

To start the process of load testing, you should start by building dashboards for your application’s utilization metrics\. These metrics include CPU utilization, memory utilization, I/O operations, I/O queue depth, and network throughput\. You can collect these metrics with a service such as CloudWatch Container Insights\. Or, do so by using Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus together with Amazon Managed Grafana\. During this process, make sure that you collect and plot metrics for your application’s response times or work completion rates\.

When load testing, begin with a small request or job insertion rate\. Keep this rate steady for several minutes to allow your application to warm up\. Then, slowly increase the rate and hold it steady for a few minutes\. Repeat this cycle, increasing the rate each time until your application’s response or completion times are too slow to meet your service\-level objectives \(SLOs\)\.

While load testing, examine each of the utilization metrics\. The metrics that increase along with the load are the top candidates to serve as your best utilization metrics\.

Next, identify the resource that reaches saturation\. At the same time, also examine the utilization metrics to see which one flattens out at a high level first\. Or, examine which one reaches peak and then crashes your application first\. For example, if CPU utilization increases from 0% to 70\-80% as you add load, then stays at that level after even more load is added, then it's safe to say that the CPU is saturated\. Depending on the CPU architecture, it might never reach 100%\. For example, assume that memory utilization increases as you add load, and then your application suddenly crashes when it reaches the task or Amazon EC2 instance memory limit\. In this situation, it's likely the case that memory has been fully consumed\. Multiple resources might be consumed by your application\. Therefore, choose the metric that represents the resource that depletes first\.

Last, try load testing again after doubling the number of tasks or Amazon EC2 instances\. Assume that the key metric increases, or decreases, at half the rate as before\. If this is the case, then the metric is proportional to capacity\. This is a good utilization metric for auto scaling\.

Now consider this hypothetical scenario\. Suppose that you load test an application and find that the CPU utilization eventually reaches 80% at 100 requests per second\. When more load is added, it doesn't make CPU utilization raise anymore\. However, it does make your application respond more slowly\. Then, you run the load test again, doubling the number of tasks but holding the rate at its previous peak value\. If you find the average CPU utilization falls to about 40%, then average CPU utilization is a good candidate for a scaling metric\. On the other hand, if CPU utilization remains at 80% after increasing the number of tasks, then average CPU utilization isn't a good scaling metric\. In that case, more research is needed to find a suitable metric\.

### Common application models and scaling properties<a name="capacity-autoscaling-app-common"></a>

Software of all kinds are run on AWS\. Many workloads are homegrown, whereas others are based on popular open\-source software\. Regardless of where they originate, we have observed some common design patterns for services\. How to scale effectively depends in large part on the pattern\.

#### The efficient CPU\-bound server<a name="capacity-autoscaling-app-common-cpu"></a>

The efficient CPU\-bound server utilizes almost no resources other than CPU and network throughput\. Each request can be handled by the application alone\. Requests don't depend on other services such as databases\. The application can handle hundreds of thousands of concurrent requests, and can efficiently utilize multiple CPUs to do so\. Each request is either serviced by a dedicated thread with low memory overhead, or there's an asynchronous event loop that runs on each CPU that services requests\. Each replica of the application is equally capable of handling a request\. The only resource that might be depleted before CPU is network bandwidth\. In CPU bound\-services, memory utilization, even at peak throughput, is a fraction of the resources available\.

This type of application is suitable for CPU\-based auto scaling\. The application enjoys maximum flexibility in terms of scaling\. It can be scaled vertically by providing larger Amazon EC2 instances or Fargate vCPUs to it\. And, it can also be scaled horizontally by adding more replicas\. Adding more replicas, or doubling the instance size, cuts the average CPU utilization relative to capacity by half\.

If you're using Amazon EC2 capacity for this application, consider placing it on compute\-optimized instances such as the `c5` or `c6g` family\.

#### The efficient memory\-bound server<a name="capacity-autoscaling-app-common-memory"></a>

The efficient memory\-bound server allocates a significant amount of memory per request\. At maximum concurrency, but not necessarily throughput, memory is depleted before the CPU resources are depleted\. Memory associated with a request is freed when the request ends\. Additional requests can be accepted as long as there is available memory\.

This type of application is suitable for memory\-based auto scaling\. The application enjoys maximum flexibility in terms of scaling\. It can be scaled both vertically by providing larger Amazon EC2 or Fargate memory resources to it\. And, it can also be scaled horizontally by adding more replicas\. Adding more replicas, or doubling the instance size, can cut the average memory utilization relative to capacity by half\.

If you're using Amazon EC2 capacity for this application, consider placing it on memory\-optimized instances such as the `r5` or `r6g` family\.

Some memory\-bound applications don't free the memory that's associated with a request when it ends, so that a reduction in concurrency doesn't result in a reduction in the memory used\. For this, we don't recommend that you use memory\-based scaling\. 

#### The worker\-based server<a name="capacity-autoscaling-app-common-worker"></a>

The worker\-based server processes one request for each individual worker thread one after another\. The worker threads can be lightweight threads, such as POSIX threads\. They can also be heavier\-weight threads, such as UNIX processes\. No matter which thread they are, there's always a maximum concurrency that the application can support\. Usually the concurrency limit is set proportionally to the memory resources that are available\. If the concurrency limit is reached, additional requests are placed into a backlog queue\. If the backlog queue overflows, additional incoming requests are immediately rejected\. Common applications that fit this pattern include Apache web server and Gunicorn\.

Request concurrency is usually the best metric for scaling this application\. Because there's a concurrency limit for each replica, it's important to scale out before the average limit is reached\.

The best way to obtain request concurrency metrics is to have your application report them to CloudWatch\. Each replica of your application can publish the number of concurrent requests as a custom metric at a high frequency\. We recommend that the frequency is set to be at least once every minute\. After several reports are collected, you can use the average concurrency as a scaling metric\. This metric is calculated by taking the total concurrency and dividing it by the number of replicas\. For example, if total concurrency is 1000 and the number of replicas is 10, then the average concurrency is 100\.

If your application is behind an Application Load Balancer, you can also use the `ActiveConnectionCount` metric for the load balancer as a factor in the scaling metric\. The `ActiveConnectionCount` metric must be divided by the number of replicas to obtain an average value\. The average value must be used for scaling, as opposed to the raw count value\.

For this design to work best, the standard deviation of response latency should be small at low request rates\. We recommend that, during periods of low demand, most requests are answered within a short time, and there isn't a lot of requests that take significantly longer than average time to respond\. The average response time should be close to the 95th percentile response time\. Otherwise, queue overflows might occur as result\. This leads to errors\. We recommend that you provide additional replicas where necessary to mitigate the risk of overflow\.

#### The waiting server<a name="capacity-autoscaling-app-common-waiting"></a>

The waiting server does some processing for each request, but it is highly dependent on one or more downstream services to function\. Container applications often make heavy use of downstream services like databases and other API services\. It can take some time for these services to respond, particularly in high capacity or high concurrency scenarios\. This is because these applications tend to use few CPU resources and their maximum concurrency in terms of available memory\.

The waiting service is suitable either in the memory\-bound server pattern or the worker\-based server pattern, depending on how the application is designed\. If the application’s concurrency is limited only by memory, then average memory utilization should be used as a scaling metric\. If the application’s concurrency is based on a worker limit, then average concurrency should be used as a scaling metric\.

#### The Java\-based server<a name="capacity-autoscaling-app-common-java"></a>

If your Java\-based server is CPU\-bound and scales proportionally to CPU resources, then it might be suitable for the efficient CPU\-bound server pattern\. If that is the case, average CPU utilization might be appropriate as a scaling metric\. However, many Java applications aren't CPU\-bound, making them challenging to scale\.

For the best performance, we recommend that you allocate as much memory as possible to the Java Virtual Machine \(JVM\) heap\. Recent versions of the JVM, including Java 8 update 191 or later, automatically set the heap size as large as possible to fit within the container\. This means that, in Java, memory utilization is rarely proportional to application utilization\. As the request rate and concurrency increases, memory utilization remains constant\. Because of this, we don't recommend scaling Java\-based servers based on memory utilization\. Instead, we typically recommend scaling on CPU utilization\.

In some cases, Java\-based servers encounter heap exhaustion before exhausting CPU\. If your application is prone to heap exhaustion at high concurrency, then average connections are the best scaling metric\. If your application is prone to heap exhaustion at high throughput, then average request rate is the best scaling metric\.

#### Servers that use other garbage\-collected runtimes<a name="capacity-autoscaling-app-common-garbage"></a>

Many server applications are based on runtimes that perform garbage collection such as \.NET and Ruby\. These server applications might fit into one of the patterns described earlier\. However, as with Java, we don't recommend scaling these applications based on memory, because their observed average memory utilization is often uncorrelated with throughput or concurrency\.

For these applications, we recommend that you scale on CPU utilization if the application is CPU bound\. Otherwise, we recommend that you scale on average throughput or average concurrency, based on your load testing results\.

#### Job processors<a name="capacity-autoscaling-app-common-job"></a>

Many workloads involve asynchronous job processing\. They include applications that don't receive requests in real time, but instead subscribe to a work queue to receive jobs\. For these types of applications, the proper scaling metric is almost always queue depth\. Queue growth is an indication that pending work outstrips processing capacity, whereas an empty queue indicates that there's more capacity than work to do\.

AWS messaging services, such as Amazon SQS and Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, provide CloudWatch metrics that can be used for scaling\. For Amazon SQS, `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` is the best metric\. For Kinesis Data Streams, consider using the `MillisBehindLatest` metric, published by the Kinesis Client Library \(KCL\)\. This metric should be averaged across all consumers before using it for scaling\.
