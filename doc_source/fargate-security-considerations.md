# AWS Fargate security considerations<a name="fargate-security-considerations"></a>

Each task has a dedicated infrastructure capacity because Fargate runs each workload on an isolated virtual environment\. Workloads that run on Fargate do not share network interfaces, ephemeral storage, CPU, or memory with other tasks\. You can run multiple containers within a task including application containers and sidecar containers, or simply sidecars\. A *sidecar* is a container that runs alongside an application container in an Amazon ECS task\. While the application container runs core application code, processes running in sidecars can augment the application\. Sidecars help you segregate application functions into dedicated containers, making it easier for you to update parts of your application\.

Containers that are part of the same task share resources for the Fargate launch type because these containers will always run on the same host and share compute resources\. These containers also share the ephemeral storage provided by Fargate\. Linux containers in a task share network namespaces, including the IP address and network ports\. Inside a task, containers that belong to the task can inter\-communicate over localhost\. 

The runtime environment in Fargate prevents you from using certain controller features that are supported on EC2 instances\. Consider the following when you architect workloads that run on Fargate: 
+ No privileged containers or access \- Features such as privileged containers or access are currently unavailable on Fargate\. This will affect uses cases such as running Docker in Docker\.
+  Limited access to Linux capabilities \- The environment in which containers run on Fargate is restricted to prevent container breakouts\. Fargate supports adding the `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` Linux capability, to allow observability tools like Sysdig Falco for workloads running on Fargate\. For information about the Sysdig Falco project with Fargate, see [Falco Support on AWS Fargate](https://sysdig.com/blog/falco-support-on-aws-fargate/) on the Sysdig website\. Workloads, including third party solutions such as Istio, that require additional Linux capabilities are currently unsupported on Fargate\. For a complete list of capabilities for Fargate, see [moby](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/deda3d4933d3c0bd57f2cef672da5d28fc653706/oci/caps/defaults.go#L4) on the GitHub website\.
+ No access to the underlying host \- Neither customers nor AWS operators can connect to a host running customer workloads\. You can use ECS exec to run commands in or get a shell to a container running on Fargate\. You can use ECS exec to help collect diagnostic information for debugging\. Fargate also prevents containers from accessing the underlying hostâ€™s resources, such as the file system, devices, networking, and container runtime\. 
+ Networking \- You can use security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic\. Fargate tasks receive an IP address from the configured subnet in your VPC\.
